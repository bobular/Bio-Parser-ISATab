Bio-Parser-ISATab

This module makes a gallant attempt to read ISA-Tab files for an investigation
into one deep hash-based data structure.  It is read-only at the moment,
and the best usage information can be found in the test scripts
t/01-invest.t
t/02-study.t
t/03-assay.t

It's in a very basic state at the moment.  Contributions, testing and
general comments are welcome.  Limitations are listed in the main
documentation 'perldoc Bio::Parser::ISATab'.

To get a good idea of the hash structure, see the test scripts for
how to load in an ISA-Tab directory - create a VERY small (one or two sample)
ISA-Tab file, load it and do:

  use Data::Dumper;
  print Dumper($isa);
