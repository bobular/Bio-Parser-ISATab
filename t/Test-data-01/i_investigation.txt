"Study Protocol Description"	"Wild anopheline larvae were collected and transported to the insectary at the Blue Nile Research and Training Institute (BNRTI) in Wad Medani, where they were reared."	"Indoor resting collections were carried out at Tabat, El Hoosh, El Khoor, El Managil and El Booster, all of which are subjected to indoor residual spraying (IRS) with deltamethrin 2.5% wettable powder."	"The resulting adults were identified as A. gambiae complex according to the morphological keys (Gillies and Coetzee, 1987)."	"A subsample of mosquitoes used for insecticide exposures (both dead and surviving) and those collected resting indoors were identified to species level using the species-specific PCR assay. "	"The ELISA methods for blood meal identification (Beier et al., 1988) were used."	"One- to three-day-old female mosquitoes were tested with different insecticides for their susceptibility, using the WHO standard protocol (WHO, 1998) under optimum conditions (temperature 26–29 °C and 70–80% relative humidity). The results were recorded as either dead or alive mosquitoes 24 h post-exposure. Insecticides tested were 0.75% permethrin, 4% DDT, 5% malathion and 0.1% bendiocarb. The test kits and the impregnated papers were obtained from the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) in Cairo, Egypt. Each test had five replicates on papers impregnated with the above-mentioned insecticides and a control tube with oil-treated paper, i.e. without insecticide. A total of 20–25 mosquitoes was used per tube. Knockdown was recorded after 1 h and final mortality was recorded 24 h post-exposure, during which time a 10% sugar solution was made available to survivors. Dead and surviving mosquitoes were stored separately in clearly labeled 1.5 ml tubes containing silica gel."
